Detrital MC version 3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code does Monte Carlo sampling of predicted age distributions and compares
them to either other predicted age distributions or observed ages. The
comparison is done using the Kuiper test and summary statistics report what
percentage of the predicted age distributions are statistically equivalent to
the measured age distribution.

Version 2.0 included a number of improvements in code usability, the most
significant of which wsa use of an input file (det_mc_input.txt) to specify
model input values. In addition, predicted thermochronometer ages are now taken
directly from the Comparison.txt file generated by Pecube. The HUGG version of
Pecube must be used with version 2.0 and later of Detrital MC. Finally, some
directory locations have also changed, but version 2.0 was broadly similar to
version 1.0 in terms of the PDF calculations.

Version 3.0 is very similar to version 2.0, but includes the option to specify
or calculate a PDF scaling factor alpha. This factor, described in section 2.3
of Brandon (1996), prevents the double smoothing of the predicted PDFs calculated
using Detrital MC (as chronicled by Vermeesch (2007)). The code is currently
otherwise identical to version 2.0, but the input file has changed, so we're
assigning a new version number. Presently, input files for version 2.0 of
detrital MC will not work with version 3.0.
