Detrital MC version 2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code does Monte Carlo sampling of predicted age distributions and compares
them to either other predicted age distributions or observed ages. The
comparison is done using the Kuiper test and summary statistics report what
percentage of the predicted age distributions are statistically equivalent to
the measured age distribution.

Version 2.0 includes a number of improvements in code usability, the most
significant of which use of an input file (det_mc_input.txt) to specify model
input values. In addition, predicted thermochronometer ages are now taken
directly from the Comparison.txt file generated by Pecube. The HUGG version of
Pecube must be used with version 2.0 of Detrital MC. Otherwise, some directory
locations have also changed, but version 2.0 is broadly similar to version 1.0
in terms of the PDF calculations.
