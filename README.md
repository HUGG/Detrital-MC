This code reads files containing predicted thermochronometer ages and performs
Monte Carlo sampling of the predicted age data to produce predicted age
distributions and compare them to either other predicted age distributions or
observed age data. The comparison is done using the Kuiper test and summary
statistics report the percentage of the predicted age distributions are
statistically equal to the measured age distribution.

Version 2.0 included a number of improvements in code usability, the most
significant of which was use of an input file (det_mc_input.txt) to specify
model input values. In addition, predicted thermochronometer ages can now be
taken directly from the Comparison.txt file generated by the HUGG version of
Pecube (available online at https://github.com/HUGG/Pecube-HUGG). Note that the
HUGG version of Pecube must be used with version 2.0 and later of Detrital MC.
Finally, some directory locations have also changed, but version 2.0 was broadly
similar to version 1.0 in terms of the PDF calculations.

Version 3.0 is similar to version 2.0, but includes the option to specify or
calculate a PDF scaling factor alpha. This factor, described in section 2.3 of
Brandon (1996), prevents the double smoothing of the predicted PDFs calculated
using Detrital MC (as chronicled by Vermeesch (2007)). In addition, there are
several new formats for the predicted age input data, which are described in the
input file for Detrital MC. The code is currently otherwise identical to version
2.0, but the input file has changed, so we're assigning a new version number.
Input files for version 2.0 of detrital MC will not work with version 3.0.
