## Introduction

This code reads files containing predicted thermochronometer ages and performs Monte Carlo sampling of the predicted age data to produce predicted age distributions and compare them to either other predicted age distributions or observed age data.
The comparison is done using the Kuiper test and summary statistics report the percentage of the predicted age distributions are statistically equal to the measured age distribution.

Version 2.0 included a number of improvements in code usability, the most significant of which was use of an input file ([`det_mc_input.txt`](https://github.com/HUGG/Detrital-MC/blob/master/input/det_mc_input.txt)) to specify model input values.
In addition, predicted thermochronometer ages can now be taken directly from the `Comparison.txt` file generated by the HUGG version of Pecube (available online at https://github.com/HUGG/Pecube-HUGG).
Note that the HUGG version of Pecube must be used with version 2.0 and later of Detrital MC.
Finally, some directory locations have also changed, but version 2.0 was broadly similar to version 1.0 in terms of the PDF calculations.

Version 3.0 is similar to version 2.0, but includes the option to specify or calculate a PDF scaling factor alpha.
This factor, described in section 2.3 of [Brandon (1996)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1350-4487(97)82880-6), prevents the double smoothing of the predicted PDFs calculated using Detrital MC (as chronicled by [Vermeesch (2007)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JF000671)).
In addition, there are several new formats for the predicted age input data, which are described in the input file for Detrital MC.
The code is currently otherwise identical to version 2.0, but the input file has changed, so we're assigning a new version number.
Input files for version 2.0 of detrital MC will not work with version 3.0.
