Input file
==========

Here we explain the input file used to control Detrital MC, where all parameters for a Detrital MC model and the locations of input data files are specified.
The `input file <https://github.com/HUGG/Detrital-MC/blob/master/input/det_mc_input.txt>`_ is located in the ``input`` subdirectory.
Note that you can freely add comments in your copies of the Detrital MC input file by starting lines with the ``$`` character.

Below, we desribe the different sections of the Detrital MC input file and how they work.
Please check the rest of the documentation for more detailed explanations of how other parts the software operate.

Section 1: Basin summary information
------------------------------------

The first section of the Detrital MC input file is for specifying how many basins are being analyzed, and the names, formats, and associated parameters for the input data files.
The input values are described in more detail below.

    $=== [1] - Basin summary information ===========================================
    1
    BH398-AFT 3 BH398_WB009-1km_Pecube_and_topometrics_250m 8 97 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1

Section 1, line 1 (1 required value)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Value a**: Number of basins to analyze. Type: ``int``

    The only input value here is the number of basins to analyze.

Section 1, line 2+ (4+ required values)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In section 1, the remaining line(s) are used to provide information about each of the basins that should be analyzed.
You should use one line per basin.

- **Value a**: Name of the observed age data file in the ``data/observed_ages`` subdirectory. Type: ``char``

    Listing ``ba1`` would tell Detrital MC to read measured ages from the ``data/observed_ages/ba1.dat`` file.
    This should be a character string.

- **Value b**: Predicted age file format. Type: ``int``

    **NOTE**: Values c, d, ... differ depending on the value selected for value 2 on this line.
    As a result, we list the corresponding descriptions of those values below each number below.

    If value b = 1: ``Comparison.txt`` file generated by `HUGG version of Pecube <https://github.com/HUGG/Pecube-HUGG>`_. Complete this line with the following values:

    - **Value c**: Name of the Pecube model run output directory (e.g., ``RUN00``) in the ``data`` subdirectory. Type: ``char`` 
    - **Value d**: The predicted thermochronometer age system to use (``1`` = AHe, ``2`` = AFT, ``3`` = ZHe, ``4`` = ZFT, ``5`` = MAr). Type: ``int``

    2. Generic CSV file

        If you set Value b equal to 2, you should complete this line with the following values:

        - **Value c**: Name of the predicted age file in the data subdirectory (e.g., ``DW001`` for ``DW001.csv``). Type: ``char``
        - **Value d**: The number of the column containing predicted ages in the CSV file. Type: ``int``
        - **Value e**: The number of the column containing predicted erosion rates in the CSV file. Type: ``int``

            If value e is equal to 16, 17, 18, 19, 98, or 99, additional information is required.
