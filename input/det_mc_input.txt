$=== [2] - Number of grains to consider in predicted age PDFs ==================
$ Line 1: [int]
$ (a) Number of different sample sizes, nss, to consider
$   - If nss < 1, the code will use the number in the observed age PDF
$   - If nss > 0, you should list nss samples sizes below
$ Line 2: [int(1) int(2)...int(nss)]
$ (a) Number of 'grains' in each sample, separated by a single space
$   - If nss < 1, this value is read, but ignored

$=== [4] - PDF comparison ======================================================
$ Line 1: [int int int int int flt]
$ (a) Observed age and full predicted age PDFs (yes = 1, no = 0)
$ (b) Observed age and Monte Carlo predicted age PDFs (yes = 1, no = 0)
$ (c) Full predicted age and Monte Carlo predicted age PDFs (yes = 1, no = 0)
$ (d) Use empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) rather than CSPDFs
$     for PDF comparisons (Kuiper's test) (yes = 1, no = 0)
$     NOTE: You must set option (e) below equal to 1 to use ECDFs
$ (e) Use new Kuiper's test formulation or original? (yes = 1, no = 0)
$     The differences between the two versions are trivial, but the new version
$     must be used for comparison of ECDFs.
$     NOTE: Currently, you must use a fixed age range for the PDFs/CDFs/ECDFs to
$     use the new Kuiper's test. A fixed age range can be set using (d) and (e)
$     in section 7 of this file.
$ (f) Kuiper's test significance level. A value of 0.05 is recommended (95%
$     confidence interval

$     NOTE: If option 4 in section 3 (use empirical CDFs) is equal to 1, the
$     output distributions will be empirical cumulative distribution functions
$     (ECDFs), otherwise they will be cumulative density functions (CDFs)
$ (e) Observed age cumulative distribution (yes = 1, no = 0)
$ (f) Full predicted age cumulative distribution (yes = 1, no = 0)

$ (h) Approximate number of values in scaled age PDFs (50., unless you know what
$     you're doing)
